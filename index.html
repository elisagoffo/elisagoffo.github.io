								<!-- Introduction --!>
								Welcome to my personal website! I am an Italian astrophysicist currently working in Germany and dedicated to discovering the mysteries of exoplanets. My research focuses on the discovery and characterization of these distant worlds using data from space and ground-based telescopes, employing methods such as transits and radial velocities.
								In addition to research, I am also involved in science communication through social media and live events in schools. I love to share my passion for astronomy with others!
								Besides engaging in science, I love to sing, listen to music, do yoga, and much more.

								In addition to scientific research, I am passionate about science communication. I actively engage with the public through social media and live events, including meetings in schools. My goal is to present science and astrophysics in an accessible, engaging and catchy way. I aim to show how the world of scientific research works, how one becomes an astrophysicist, and what this career entails.
